         	What I am doing this weekend is going to a family picnic at Black Berry Farm. We go there every year. We eat a lot of foods such as ribs, chicken, pasta, cakes, e.t.c. On Sunday, I am going to the Haight and getting a new nose hoop. Then go home and do the rest of my homework. I will also eat dinner and get ready for the next day.
